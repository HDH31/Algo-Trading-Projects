# Algorithmic Trading Projects

This repository is dedicated to a collection of algorithmic trading projects that showcase the application of statistical models, machine learning, and quantitative finance techniques to develop trading strategies and market analysis tools. Each project within this repository is designed to provide insights into different aspects of financial markets, leveraging data science and technology to inform trading decisions and strategy development.

## Repository Overview

The projects in this repository are organized into two main categories, each focusing on a specific area of algorithmic trading:

### Quantitative Finance Models

Projects in this category apply various statistical and machine learning models to analyze financial markets, predict market movements, and optimize investment portfolios. Here's a brief overview of each project:

- **[Basket-Hedging](/Quantitative-Finance-Models/Basket-Hedging)**: Demonstrates a hedging strategy to optimize portfolio performance using techniques like Linear Regression and XGBoost.
- **[DBSCAN-Pair-Selection](/Quantitative-Finance-Models/DBSCAN-Pair-Selection)**: Uses the DBSCAN clustering algorithm and PCA for selecting stock pairs suitable for pair trading strategies.
- **[Random-Forest](/Quantitative-Finance-Models/Random-Forest)**: Develops a Random Forest model to predict the next day's return of the HSCEI Index.
- **[ML-Regression](/Quantitative-Finance-Models/ML-Regression)**: Employs Linear Regression to predict the NIKKEI index's high and low prices for trading decisions.
- **[ARCH-vs-GARCH](/Quantitative-Finance-Models/ARCH-vs-GARCH)**: Analyzes volatility prediction using ARCH and GARCH models for market data.

### Trading Strategies

This section is focused on the development and testing of systematic trading strategies, utilizing quantitative methods to create and evaluate the effectiveness of each strategy:

- **[BreakoutStrategy-BBANDS](/Trading-Strategies/BreakoutStrategy-BBANDS)**: Implements a trend-following strategy using Bollinger Bands on the NIKKEI Index.

Future projects will be added to explore new strategies and extend the repository's coverage of algorithmic trading topics.
